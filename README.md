## Introduction

![](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/20191104101735947.png)

**Canal [kə'næl]**, translated as waterway/pipe/ditch, the main purpose is to provide incremental data subscription and consumption based on MySQL database incremental log parsing

In the early days, due to the deployment of dual computer rooms in Hangzhou and the United States, there was a business requirement for cross-computer room synchronization. The implementation method was mainly based on business triggers to obtain incremental changes. Since 2010, the business has gradually tried to parse database logs to obtain incremental changes for synchronization, and a large number of incremental database subscription and consumption businesses have been derived from this.

Services based on log incremental subscription and consumption include
- Database mirroring
- Database real-time backup
- Index construction and real-time maintenance (split heterogeneous index, inverted index, etc.)
- Business cache refresh
- Incremental data processing with business logic

The current canal supports source MySQL versions including 5.1.x , 5.5.x , 5.6.x , 5.7.x , 8.0.x

## Working principle
#### MySQL master and backup replication principle
![](![mysql_master_slave_replication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31732943/211264721-878603fd-39d8-4940-bb2e-199cd78f867b.png)
- MySQL master writes data changes to the binary log (binary log, where the records are called binary log events, which can be viewed through show binlog events)
- MySQL slave (I/O thread) receives the master's binary logs and copies to its relay log
- MySQL slave (SQL thread) replays events in the relay log, reflecting data changes to its own data

#### How canal works
- Canal simulates the interactive protocol of MySQL slave, pretends to be MySQL slave, and sends dump protocol to MySQL master
- MySQL master receives dump request and starts to push binary log to slave (ie canal)
- Canal parse binary log object (originally byte stream)

## Multi-languages

Canal specially designed the client-server mode, the interactive protocol uses protobuf 3.0, the client side can use different languages to implement different consumption logic, welcome to submit a pull request
